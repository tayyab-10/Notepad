Notepad Application Using C++ and Doubly Linked List

Welcome to the Notepad Application repository! This project is a feature-rich notepad application implemented in C++ using a doubly linked list data structure. The application provides a practical example of how data structures can be used to manage and manipulate text data efficiently.

Features

Efficient Text Editing: Utilizes a doubly linked list to allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and modification of text.

Command-Based Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive command-based interface for interacting with the notepad.

Undo/Redo Functionality: Supports undo and redo operations to revert or reapply changes.

Navigation: Allows easy navigation through the text using cursor movements.

File Operations: Supports saving and loading text files, making it easy to work with existing documents.

Search and Replace: Includes basic search and replace functionality to quickly find and update text.

Data Structure

Doubly Linked List
The core of the application is built around a doubly linked list, which offers several advantages for text manipulation:

Bidirectional Traversal: Allows for efficient forward and backward traversal of the text.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Can handle text of arbitrary length without predefined size limits.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Provides O(1) complexity for insertion and deletion operations at any point in the text.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
CMake (optional, for building with CMake)
